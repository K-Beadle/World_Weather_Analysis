# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

Collect and analyze weather data from around the globe

### Purpose

The purpose was to create a service that recommends hotels to stay at based on a clients preference of weather by using API calls from google maps and openweathermap.com. 

## Results

Using the two sources mentioned above, we can now give good recommendations to clients who wish to find a place to stay with their preference. The following is an image that represents recommended hotels for someone who prefers weather to be between 75 and 90 degrees fahrenheit.

Furthermore, the interactive portion of the service is quite informative and very user friendly. Simply select a marker that indicates a good hotel for your search criteria and you will the see the name of the city, the country, the name of the hotel, the current temperature, and the maximum temperature that will occur there.

## Summary

By utilizing API calls and using input() function in our code, we are able to create a very user friendly and convenient quick service for any client you wish to assist with travel plans. In addition, I believe this is great information and it is possible to use these locations and their information to market and advertise to people to get them to travel more. Programs like this can help small hotels that maybe don't get as much attention or maybe a brand new hotel in an area that is desirable. 

I believe it is noteworthy to point out that tools like this would certainly make business increase for hotels if utilized effectivley.
